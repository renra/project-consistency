# Project Consistency - Virtualization

## What is it?

* Virtual machines running on abstractions from the actual hardware and OS

## Score

Not fast with VirtualBox, suffers from drift.

* [x] Easy to setup for a new developer - with tools like [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [ ] Fast
* [x] Same developer experience across various OSes
* [x] Same environment in development and production (and CI)
* [x] Project isolation
